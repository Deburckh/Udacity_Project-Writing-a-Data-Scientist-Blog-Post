# Udacity_Project-Writing-a-Data-Scientist-Blog-Post

Libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Seaborn

Motivation:
- In this project I had a look at the accommodation prices for Seattle based Airbnb's. I tried to answer three questions all regarding the price of an accommodation, including seasonal fluctuations, differences in neighbourhoods and whether it is possible to predict future prices based on given features. 

Files:
- In this repository you can find the jupyter notebook I used for the analysis and the three data sets (calander.csv for bookings, listings.csv for accommodation specific data and reviews.csv for review data), all packaged into one .zip file. 

Summary: 
- Question 1: Are there any seasonal fluctuations regarding the price of an accomodation, for example is the summer more expensive than the winter? 
  - It seem's that there are indeed some seasonal fluctuations in the price. There is a rise in prices starting in Spring with a peak during July. Summer time in general seems like the most expensive season.
 
- Question 2: Does the neighborhood have an impact on the price of the accomodation?
  - There is a huge difference in prices in the different neighbourhoods. Magnolia is almost double as expensive on average as Delridge.

- Question 3: Can we make a prediction on the price using different features?
  - Despite there being way less predicted values, the overall trend seems to be very similar, with a peak in the same spot. Therefore it seems reasonable to say that a prediction on the price is somewhat possible, given the circumstances.
