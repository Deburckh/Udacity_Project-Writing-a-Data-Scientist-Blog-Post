# Udacity_Project-Writing-a-Data-Scientist-Blog-Post

Libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Seaborn

Motivation:
- In this project I had a look at the accommodation prices for Seattle based Airbnb's. I tried to answer three questions all regarding the price of an accommodation, including seasonal fluctuations, differences in neighbourhoods and whether it is possible to predict future prices based on given features. 

Files:
- In this repository you can find the jupyter notebook I used for the analysis and the three data sets (calander.csv for bookings, listings.csv for accommodation specific data and reviews.csv for review data), all packaged into one .zip file. 

Summary: 
- Question 1: Are there any seasonal fluctuations regarding the price of an accomodation, for example is the summer more expensive than the winter? 
  - Test
 
- Question 2: Does the neighborhood have an impact on the price of the accomodation?
  - Test

- Question 3: Can we make a prediction on the price using different features?
  - Test
